Design Patterns

- Factory pattern: This pattern provides an interface for creating objects in
superclass, 
but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created

- Abstract Factory: lets you produce families of related objects without 
specifying their concrete classes.
- Singleton: Singleton ensures that a class has only one instance, while 
providing a global access point to this instance.
